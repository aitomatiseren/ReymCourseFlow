## High-Level Architecture

This is a **Training and Certification Management System** built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase, enhanced with AI-powered assistance and comprehensive provider management.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite as build tool
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) with enhanced context management
- **Routing**: React Router v6

   - `/pages/` - Route-level components with new pages (Settings, Providers, etc.)
   - `/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for data fetching and business logic
   - `/services/ai/` - Complete AI service integration layer

2. **Database Structure** (Supabase):
   - `employees` - Employee records with Dutch-specific fields and status history
   - `courses` - Training course definitions with provider integration
